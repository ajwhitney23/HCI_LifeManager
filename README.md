# HCI_LifeManager
HCI Term Long Project

The Goal of this project was to get a better understanding of the design process used in the industry.  We explored different 
evaluation methods, and how to adjust our project as a result of the feedback received.  We learned about how to make changes, keeping impact and severity in mind.  

He Goal of LifePlanner is to make a student's day easier.  It is supposed to help them plan better and waste less time.  It is attempting to condense all of the needs of students into one place, with collaboration, budgeting, scheduling being the most used applicaitons students use.  With more time, this project would include collaboration between students creating scheudles, and implement calculating the time it would take for a student to transition from one task to the next (walking times, food, etc).
